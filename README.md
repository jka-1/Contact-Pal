## About

Contact‑Pal is an application for managing and sharing contacts. It provides secure user login, CRUD operations for contact data, and a user‑friendly frontend.  

---

## Features

Here are some of the key capabilities:

- User authentication / login  
- Frontend UI to view, add, edit, delete contacts  
- Backend API endpoints for contact operations  
- Storage of contact information (name, phone, email, etc.)  
- Secure communication between frontend and backend  

---

## Architecture

Structure of the project:

```
/
├── frontend/          → Client‑side code (HTML / JavaScript / UI)
├── API_endpoints/     → Backend API (probably PHP in this repo)
├── Login.php          → Login logic
├── README.md          → This file
└── LICENSE            → Apache‑2.0 license
```

- Frontend interacts with API endpoints for data operations  
- Login is handled via `Login.php` (server‑side)  
- Data storage (database) configuration not included (you’ll need to set that up)

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript, CSS  
- **Backend**: PHP

## Getting Started

To set up and run Contact‑Pal locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jka-1/Contact-Pal.git
   cd Contact-Pal
   ```

2. Setup your backend environment:  
   - Install a PHP runtime/server (e.g. Apache / Nginx + PHP)  
   - Configure a database (e.g. MySQL, MariaDB, etc.)  
   - Create any necessary tables for users and contacts  

3. Configure the API endpoints and database connection (you may need to create configuration files or update a `.env`‑type file).  

4. Serve the frontend, ensuring it can reach the backend API (CORS, URLs, etc.).  

5. Access via browser, login, start adding contacts.
